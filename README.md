## Model Providers

This app ships with [Openai](https://openai.com/) provider as the default. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [Ollama](https://ollama.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

- Mini model (`gpt-4o-mini`): A fast and efficient model suitable for simple tasks
- Large model (`gpt-4o`): A powerful model designed for complex tasks
- Reasoning model (`o4-mini`): An advanced model configured for multi-step reasoning tasks

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the OpenChat to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmurabcd%2Fopenchat&env=CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY,OPENAI_API_KEY&envDescription=Learn%20more%20about%20how%20to%20get%20the%20API%20Keys%20for%20the%20application&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmurabcd%2Fopenchat%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.example&demo-title=OpenChat&demo-description=An%20open-source%20AI%20chatbot%20built%20with%20Next.js%2015%2C%20Convex%2C%20and%20AI%20SDK.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fopenchat-beta.vercel.app)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run OpenChat. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Run Vercel via Bun: `bunx vercel link`
2. Download your environment variables: `bunx vercel env pull`

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
